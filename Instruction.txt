Spiderman met a crashed Bus. As a great neighbour of the public, the hero needs to discover and collect at least four energy boxes distributed 
within the sences. Then load them on to the Bus one by one. After the energy bar is fullfilled (4 /4), the spiderman can use the 'interaction' action to make the 
Bus move again. 



Controller: Only use keyboards
 
Avater Control:
- Move: Use Up Down Right Left to move
- Fly: Hold the 'Space' to jet fly
- Interaction :Simply press 'F' (Don't hold it) to collect energy bar, load the car also make the car move.
	(It may fail in some cases , just try it again)

Camera Control:
- Yaw "Q" and "W"
- Pitch "C" and "V"
- Move "E" "W" "S" "D" 
I set it for a easier finding the hidden 'energy bar' needed to be collected

Sence Control
- If you prefer a dark sence
- Press 'G' to change its theme


When you approach an iteractive object ,an orange sign will appear on the top of avater, then perform 'F' it will work.
